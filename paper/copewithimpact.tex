\section{Coping With the Impact}
\label{sec:cope}

Test dependence causes non-trivial repercussions
to downstream testing techniques.
When test dependence arises, testing techniques
should properly handle the potential dependence 
and keep the test execution results consistent.

Consider a test prioritization
or selection algorithm. By design, if its input is a passing test
suite, then its output should be a passing test suite. If the
suite contains a dependent test, then prioritization
or selection can introduce test failures, which violates the
design requirement.


This section presents a family of techniques to cope with
the impact of test dependence on test prioritization, selection,
and parallelization techniques. 
Our techniques enhance the existing techniques to ensure
they produce an order in which each test yields the same
result as in the original test suite.
