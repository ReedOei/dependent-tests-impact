Test prioritization, selection, and parallelization are three
important downstream testing techniques. These three techniques may
change the execution order of an existing test suite in
certain ways to make it run
faster, achieve coverage faster, detect faults earlier,
or fulfill other testing goals.

\subsubsection{Test prioritization.}

Test prioritization schedules test cases
for execution in an order that attempts to
increase their effectiveness.
One application of prioritization techniques involves
regression testing --- the retesting of software following modifications;
in this context, prioritization techniques can take advantage of information gathered about the previous
execution of test cases to obtain test case orderings.

Test prioritization techniques developed in the literature
fall into three major categories: (1) techniques
that order test cases based on their total coverage of
code components; (2) techniques that order test
cases based on their coverage of code components
not previously covered; (3) techniques that order test
cases based on their estimated ability to reveal faults
in the code components that they cover. In addition to the
test execution information, the third
category requires a comprehensive history of known
faults, which are often absent in practice.

they require a fault history that is not
available for our subject programs.)

In this paper, we focus on evaluating 5 well-known test prioritization
techniques from the first and second categories (summarized
in Figure~\ref{tab:testprio}).

%We wish to empirically investigate the validity of this unverified
%conventional wisdom, in order to understand whether
%test dependence can affect the results of test prioritization
%techniques.


\subsubsection{Test selection.}

Test selection techniques are often designed for improving
regression testing to detect whether new defects
have been introduced into previously tested code and
to provide confidence that modifications
are correct. 
%Since regression testing is an expensive process,
%researchers have proposed regression test selection (for short,
%test selection) techniques as a way to reduce some of this expense.
In general, test selection techniques attempt to select and execute
only a subset of the original test cases in a program to
reduce the testing cost.


%Since test selection techniques execute only a subset of the original
%test suite, they 
Test selection techniques may change the execution
environment (i.e., tests running before the
selected test) of each selected test. 
Test selection can also be used together with
test prioritization by prioritizing the selected
subset of tests~\cite{}. Thus, the test independence
assumption becomes particularly important to keep the
selected tests behaving the same as in the original test suite.

In this paper, we focus on evaluating 2 well-known test
selection techniques (listed
in Figure~\ref{tab:testsel}). We conduct empirical evaluations
to investigate whether test dependence will affect their results.
For each test selection technique,
we also evalaute its effectiveness when combined with each test
prioritization technique listed in Figure~\ref{tab:testprio}.

\subsubsection{Test parallelization.}

Test execution parallelization (for short, test parallelization)
schedules the input tests for execution across
multiple CPUs to reduce the test time.
Such techniques are well adopted in
industry. For example, Visual Studio 2010 (and later)
supports a model of executing tests in parallel on a multi-CPU/core machine~\cite{}.
\todo{more evidence here}

Scheduling tests to multiple machines may change the execution
environment of each test and then affect the test result.
%Similarly, the test independence assumption is also critical to
%test execution parallelization, since  
%However, this critical
%assumption still remains unverified: to the best of our
%knowledge, all existing test parallelization techniques and
%tools~\cite{} implicitly assume that each test in a test
%suite is independent from one another.
This paper focuses on \parnum test parallelization techniques
(listed in Figure~\ref{tab:testpar}) and empirically investigates
the impacts of test dependence on them.
